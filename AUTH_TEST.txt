AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM FIXES COMPLETED
=====================================

✓ FIXES APPLIED:
1. Database Setup
   - Created users_profile table with RLS policies
   - Added trigger to auto-create profiles on signup
   - Connected to auth.users via foreign key

2. Code Fixes
   - Fixed async/await in AuthContext (was using promises incorrectly)
   - Changed .single() to .maybeSingle() for safer queries
   - Added proper error handling

3. Build Status
   - ✓ All components compile
   - ✓ All assets generated
   - ✓ Tailwind CSS included (35.65 kB)
   - ✓ JavaScript bundled (902.48 kB)

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN SUPABASE DASHBOARD:
1. Enable Email Authentication provider
2. Configure Google OAuth (see AUTH_SETUP.md for steps)
3. Add redirect URLs in Authentication settings
4. Test signup/login flows

TESTING:
1. npm run dev
2. Go to /signup and create an account
3. Go to /login and sign in
4. Try Google sign-in
5. Check Supabase dashboard for created users

ERROR MESSAGES EXPLAINED:
- "Invalid API Key" → .env credentials incorrect
- Google sign-in opens login page again → OAuth not configured in Supabase
- User not staying logged in → Check browser cookies are enabled

The website should now fully display with full styling and authentication ready to test.
